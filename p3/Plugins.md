# Plugins, themes and stuff

## Plugins

🔌 [GitLens - Git supercharged](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) - I usually like to use commands line for git but this one is Perfect! I use to put its feature in the Source Control window to keep all at the same place.

🔌 [Material Icon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme) - Because icons are prettier

🔌 [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) - Consistency in code style is very important and provides many advantages. I don't know I could do without it

🔌 [Bracket Pair Colorizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer) - If you want to find matching brackets at a glance it's the best

🔌 [Github Markdown Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.github-markdown-preview) - This pack will install 4 plugins (description from the webpage).

_I use to keep a window open in the right side of my screen in VS code with the README of the project either to follow instructions/documentation or to keep my documentation up-to-date._

- Markdown Preview Github Styling - CSS that makes the preview match Github markdown style
- Markdown Emoji - Adds `:emoji:` support to the markdown preview
- Markdown Checkboxes - Adds `- [ ]` task list support to the markdown preview
- Markdown yaml Preamble - Adds support for rendering the yaml front matter as a table. Be sure to set `"markdown.previewFrontMatter": "show"`

🔌 [Markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint) - Markdown linter. Keep it standard

🔌 [npm](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eg2.vscode-npm-script) - Used to validate my package.json file mostly and to manage monorepo

🔌 [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) -
