# Regenerate state.json for p1 (p4)

We need a tool to be able to regenerate the `state.json` file if something goes wrong.

## Plan

- [x] Create script to generate the `state.json` file
  - [x] Get directories list (project codes)
  - [x] Retrieve project number from project code
  - [x] Retrieve the title from README files
  - [x] Retrieve the description from README files
  - [x] Retrieve the date when README file has been created (project start date)
- [x] Add the script in the root directory

## Improvements

_No idea yet but that will come for sure_
