# Regenerate state.json for p1 (p4)

We need a tool to be able to regenerate the `state.json` file if something goes wrong.

## Plan

- [ ] Create script to generate the `state.json` file
- [ ] Get directories list (project codes)
- [ ] Retrieve project number from project code
- [ ] Retrieve the title from README files
- [ ] Retrieve the description from README files
- [ ] Retrieve the date when README file has been created (project start date)
- [ ] Add the script in the root directory

## Improvements

_No idea yet but that will come for sure_
