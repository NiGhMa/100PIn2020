# An interactive CLI made with NodeJS and Inquirer (p1)

This is a simple interactive CLI example made with NodeJS and Inquirer.
In this example I created it to init my project folder.
After some questions, the tool will do the following:

1. creates the project directory with the next number
2. creates the README file from a template (like this one)
3. adds the reference line in the main README file
4. creates a new git branch
5. commits first files
6. opens VSCode and open the README file for change

## Plan

- [x] Create a new NodeJS project
- [x] Install Inquirer
- [x] Create questions
  - [x] Do you want to create the next project?
  - [x] What's the title?
  - [x] What's the description?
  - [x] What affixes do you want to add?
  - [x] (if affix from tutorial) Which unicorn do you want to add?
  - [x] What the plan?
- [ ] Create project directory
- [x] Retrieve last project number state file
- [ ] Update state file
- [x] Create template for README
- [ ] Add project reference in main README
- [ ] Start a new git branch
- [ ] Commit first files
- [ ] Start VSCode in the project directory and open README for change
