# An interactive CLI made with NodeJS and Inquirer (p1)

This is a simple interactive CLI example made with NodeJS and Inquirer.
In this example I created it to init my project folder.
The command will create the following:

1. the project directory
2. the README.md file from a template (like this one)
3. the reference line in the main README.md file

## Plan (to complete)

- [ ] Create a new NodeJS project

## What I've learned

âœ” Configure init value for NPM

âœ” Init a NodeJS project

âœ” Markdown syntax and conventions

## Unicrons (references)
