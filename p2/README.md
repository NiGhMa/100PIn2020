## Troubleshooting

### Git commands to remote server still ask for passphrase

This script should ask your passphrase when it starts then no more. If it's not the case, please check the following:

- Git for Windows should be installed (check for `ProgramFiles/Git` for 64-bits version or for `ProgramFiles(x86)/Git` for 32-bits version).
- Your key should be registered (check with `ssh-add -l`). If not run `ssh-add /path/to/your/key/file` then restart your Shell to validate
- `C:\Windows\System32\OpenSSH` should be removed from path (environment variable)
