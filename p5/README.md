# Typescript boilerplate (p5)

This is a simple boilerplate to use for a Typescript multi-packages project. ESLint, TS, ... all configurations are inside.

## Plan

- [ ] Prepare packages
- [ ] Init typescript project
- [ ] Init ESLint
- [ ] Configure ESLint
- [ ] Configure Prettier
- [ ] Configure TSconfig

## Improvements

_No idea yet but that will come for sure_
