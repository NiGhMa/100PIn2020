# Typescript boilerplate (p5)

This is a simple boilerplate to use for a Typescript multi-packages project. ESLint, TS, ... all configurations are inside.

## Plan

- [x] Prepare packages directories
- [x] Install `lerna`
- [x] Install `typescript`
- [x] Install `eslint`
- [x] Run `gitignore node`
- [x] Configure tsconfig for monorepo
- [x] Add Jest + config
- [x] Prettier + eslint config
